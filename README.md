CVE-2021-21551 proof of concept (PoC) exploit

https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-21551

Issue was discovered in signed dell windows driver (dbutil_2_3.sys) which may lead to compromisation of whole local system. Driver lacks of validation of user supplied buffer.

## Content
- driver = contains binary and reverse engineered pseudo code
- PoC = local privilege escalation by spawning system cmd

## IOCTL
Anyone can create handle and issue ioctl requests to these ioctl codes which break windows security model:

- 0x9b0c1f40 = arbitrary physical memory read
- 0x9b0c1f44 = arbitrary physical memory write
- 0x9b0c1ec4 = arbitrary kernel memory read
- 0x9B0C1EC8 = arbitrary kernel memory write
- 0x9b0c1ecc = controlled parameters to MmFreeContiguousMemorySpecifyCache call
- 0x9b0c1ec0 = controlled parameters to MmAllocateContiguousMemorySpecifyCache call
- 0x9b0c1f00 & 0x9b0c1f8c & 0x9b0c1f88 & 0x9b0c1f84 & 0x9b0c1f80 = access to some ports
