CVE-2021-21551 proof of concept (PoC) privilege escalation exploit

https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-21551

Issue was discovered in signed dell windows driver (dbutil_2_3.sys) which may lead to compromisation of whole local system. Driver lacks of validation of user supplied buffer.

## Content
- _PoC_ - local privilege escalation by spawning system cmd
- _driver_ - binary and reverse engineered pseudo code

## IOCTL
Anyone can create handle and issue ioctl requests to these ioctl codes which break windows security model:

- _0x9b0c1f40_ - arbitrary physical memory read
- _0x9b0c1f44_ - arbitrary physical memory write
- _0x9b0c1ec4_ - arbitrary kernel memory read
- _0x9B0C1EC8_ - arbitrary kernel memory write
- _0x9b0c1ecc_ - controlled parameters to MmFreeContiguousMemorySpecifyCache call
- _0x9b0c1ec0_ - controlled parameters to MmAllocateContiguousMemorySpecifyCache call
- _0x9b0c1f00_ & _0x9b0c1f8c_ & _0x9b0c1f88_ & _0x9b0c1f84_ & _0x9b0c1f80_ - access to some ports
